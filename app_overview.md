# The Application We'll Build

To frame all the setup needed to get an Angular app running with Rails,
we'll build a simple application to manage recipes.  The application will
simply be a store of recipes that can be searched.  A recipe is simply a title
and a set of instructions.

We'll build the application in four steps:

1. Create a skeleton that does very little but can be deployed.
2. Walk through the implementation of a basic search by name.
3. Walk briskly through a test-driven implementation of viewing a recipe.
4. Run through the implementation of creating, editing, and deleting recipes.

A basic “CRUD” app isn't going to be the best demonstration of Angular's
power, but it's easy to understand, especially for Rails developers, and will
allow us to just focus on getting things set up.

Again, since this isn't a Rails or Angular tutorial, we're going to accelerate
as we go.  The most difficult and tedious part of using a new technology is
setup, so let's do that first.
