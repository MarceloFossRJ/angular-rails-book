A few notes:

* Fixes for typos, bad grammar, and outright incorrect statements are all awesome.
* Alternatives to what's presented are unlikely to replace the main text, but I'm open to including them as sidebars or in an appendix.
* Changes to the source code are currently a bit tricky, given how this site is generated.  Don't submit a PR with massive changes to the code w/out checking with me first.
