This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribute-NonCommerical-ShareAlike license, and the source for the book can be found
in [its repo][repo].  Feel free to submit pull requests to correct any mistakes you find, with these caveats:

* **Typos/grammar-fixes/being wrong** - I love these and I'm sorry I didn't find them before you did.
* **Alternate ways to do it** - interested but less likely to replace the main text.  Could be interesting sidebars.
* **Changes to the source code** - currently, this is tricky.  I want to fix code errors, but contact me before doing a ton of work, as the code is generated from a tagged git repository.  

When in doubt, open a PR with a question and we can start from there.
